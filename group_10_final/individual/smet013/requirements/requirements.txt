# Functional Requirements

* Ventilation rate must always be higher than the gas buildup rate.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.ventRate > v.gasRate

      always (inited -> (rooms[i].ventRate > rooms[i].gasRate));

* A room's lower gas level threshold is never higher than the upper gas level
  threshold.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.lowerThresh < r.upperThresh

      always (inited -> (rooms[i].lowerBound < rooms[i].upperBound));

* If the factory is alarming and the user presses the reset button, the
  factory must stop alarming.

      AG alarm and isReset -> AF not alarm

      always ((alarming && is_reset) -> eventually !alarming)

* If the alarm is on, all rooms must be ventilating.

      AG alarm -> \forall r in rooms, r.vent

      always eventually (alarming -> rooms[i].venting)

* The factory controller should be able to receive and handle all information from room controllers before the next clock tick.

# Non-Functional Requirements

* The gas ventilation rate must be specifiable.

* The gas buildup rate must be specifiable.
