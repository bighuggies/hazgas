INSTALLING SPIN (For UNIX systems)

1. Download the tar of the latest release of spin (full distribution) from spinroot.com.
(Current version at http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/spin625.tar.gz).

2. Make sure you are in the directory containing the tarball, then unzip the file.
	
	gunzip *.tar.gz
	tar -xf *.tar

3. Change to the source directory, then run make.
	cd Src*
	make

   If you want to test the installation cd to the Test directory of the main folder, 
   and follow the instructions in the README.tests file.

4. (OPTIONAL) If you want the graphical interface for the installation (ispin), run the 
install.sh file located in the iSpin subdirectory of the main folder. 
You may need to install tcl/tk first.
