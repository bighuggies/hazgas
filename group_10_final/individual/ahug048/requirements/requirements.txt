# Functional Requirements

* Ventilation rate must always be higher than the gas buildup rate.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.ventRate > v.gasRate

      always (inited -> (rooms[i].ventRate > rooms[i].gasRate));

* A room's lower gas level threshold is never higher than the upper gas level
  threshold.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.lowerThresh < r.upperThresh

      always (inited -> (rooms[i].lowerBound < rooms[i].upperBound));

* If gas level is below lower threshold, room is not ventilating unless
  alarming.

      AG not alarm -> \forall r in rooms, r.gasVol < r.lowerThresh and not r.vent

      always (!alarming -> (rooms[i].gasVolume < rooms[i].lowerBound) -> !rooms[i].venting)

* If the alarm is on, all rooms must be ventilating.

      AG alarm -> \forall r in rooms, r.vent

      always eventually (alarming -> rooms[i].venting)

# Non-Functional Requirements

* Gas sensors must sense the level of gas accurately.

* Ventilators must not malfunction.
