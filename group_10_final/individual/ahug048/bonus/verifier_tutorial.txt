# Installing Promela on Elementary OS (an Ubuntu derivative)

## Installing Binary Distribution

1. Download the Spin binary tar file for your platform from the Spin download
page at http://spinroot.com/spin/Bin/index.html

2. Extract the downloaded file from step one. Copy, move, or link the extracted binary file to a directory on your PATH. Make sure that the file on the PATH is called simply "spin".

`sudo cp spin_linux64 /usr/local/bin/spin`

3. Make the file on your path executable.

`sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/spin`

4. Check that Spin is installed correctly by opening a Terminal and running the command `spin -V`. The output should appear as ``Spin Version 6.2.5 -- 3 May 2013'', where the version number corresponds to the version of Spin which you downloaded.

## Installing the iSpin GUI

1. Download the iSpin script from http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/index.html (ispin.tcl).

2. Give the iSpin script executable permissions.

`chmod +x ispin.tcl`

3. Run iSpin.

`./ispin.tcl`

### Troubleshooting

If you cannot run iSpin, ensure that `spin` is correctly placed on your PATH. iSpin may also require system packages for TCL and TKinter. Ensure that these prerequisites are met in order to run iSpin.
