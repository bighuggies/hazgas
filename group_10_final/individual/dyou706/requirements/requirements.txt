# Functional Requirements

* Ventilation rate must always be higher than the gas buildup rate.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.ventRate > v.gasRate

      always (inited -> (rooms[0].ventRate > rooms[0].gasRate));

* A room's lower gas level threshold is never higher than the upper gas level
  threshold.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.lowerThresh < r.upperThresh

      always (inited -> (rooms[0].lowerBound < rooms[0].upperBound));

* If the system is ventilating for more than a defined percentage of clock
  ticks over a period of time, the system must alarm in the next clock tick.

   Timing is not supported by CTL.

      always (num_ticks_alarming > ALARM_WINDOW -> alarming);

* If the alarm is on, all rooms must be ventilating.

      AG alarm -> \forall r in rooms, r.vent

      always eventually (alarming -> rooms[0].venting)

# Non-Functional Requirements

* The gas volume must build up at a steady rate.

* Each room must have a air capacity of no more than 10000 liters.
