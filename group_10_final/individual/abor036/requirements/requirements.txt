# Functional Requirements

* Ventilation rate must always be higher than the gas buildup rate.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.ventRate > v.gasRate

      always (inited -> (rooms[0].ventRate > rooms[0].gasRate));

* A room's lower gas level threshold is never higher than the upper gas level
  threshold.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.lowerThresh < r.upperThresh

      always (inited -> (rooms[0].lowerBound < rooms[0].upperBound));

* The gas level of a room, if it exceeds the upper gas threshold, must
  eventually be lower than the lower gas threshold.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.gasVol > r.upperThresh -> AF r.gasVol < r.lowerThresh

      always ((rooms[0].gasVolume > rooms[0].upperBound) -> always eventually (rooms[0].gasVolume < rooms[0].lowerBound))

* If the factory is alarming and the user presses the reset button, the
  factory must stop alarming.

      AG alarm and isReset -> AF not alarm

      always ((alarming && is_reset) -> eventually !alarming)

# Non-Functional Requirements

* The number of rooms must be specifiable.

* The gas level thresholds must be specifiable (lower and upper).
