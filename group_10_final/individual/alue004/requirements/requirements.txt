# Functional Requirements

* Ventilation rate must always be higher than the gas buildup rate.

     AG \forall r in rooms, r.ventRate > v.gasRate

* A room's lower gas level threshold is never higher than the upper gas level
  threshold.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.lowerThresh < r.upperThresh

* A room will vent if the upper gas threshold is exceeded.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.gasVol > r.upperThresh -> AX r.vent

* The gas level of a room, if it exceeds the upper gas threshold, must
  eventually be lower than the lower gas threshold.

      AG \forall r in rooms, r.gasVol > r.upperThresh -> AF r.gasVol < r.lowerThresh

# Non-Functional Requirements

* The volume of rooms must be specifiable.

* The number and percentage of venting clock ticks required to trigger the
  alarm should be specifiable.
